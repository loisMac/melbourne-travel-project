        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Lois. I'm from the UK, but I travelled to Australia in 2023 and fell in love with Melbourne.
            I plan on returning at some point, and maybe even spending an extended period of time there.
            If you like coffee and nice clothes, you're in for a treat.
